PTHREAD_CLEANUP_PUSH(3)                       Linux Programmer's Manual                       PTHREAD_CLEANUP_PUSH(3)

NAME
	   pthread_cleanup_push, pthread_cleanup_pop - push and pop thread cancellation clean-up handlers

SYNOPSIS
	   #include <pthread.h>

	   void pthread_cleanup_push(void (*routine)(void *),
								 void *arg);
	   void pthread_cleanup_pop(int execute);

	   Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
	   These  functions  manipulate  the calling thread's stack of thread-cancellation clean-up handlers.  A clean-up
	   handler is a function that is automatically executed when a thread is canceled (or in  various  other  circum\
	   stances  described below); it might, for example, unlock a mutex so that it becomes available to other threads
	   in the process.

	   The pthread_cleanup_push() function pushes routine onto the top of the stack of clean-up handlers.  When  rou\
	   tine is later invoked, it will be given arg as its argument.

	   The  pthread_cleanup_pop()  function removes the routine at the top of the stack of clean-up handlers, and op\
	   tionally executes it if execute is nonzero.

	   A cancellation clean-up handler is popped from the stack and executed in the following circumstances:

	   1. When a thread is canceled, all of the stacked clean-up handlers are popped and executed in the  reverse  of
		  the order in which they were pushed onto the stack.

	   2. When a thread terminates by calling pthread_exit(3), all clean-up handlers are executed as described in the
		  preceding point.  (Clean-up handlers are not called if the thread terminates by performing  a  return  from
		  the thread start function.)

	   3. When a thread calls pthread_cleanup_pop() with a nonzero execute argument, the top-most clean-up handler is
		  popped and executed.

	   POSIX.1 permits pthread_cleanup_push() and pthread_cleanup_pop() to be implemented as macros  that  expand  to
	   text  containing '{' and '}', respectively.  For this reason, the caller must ensure that calls to these func\
	   tions are paired within the same function, and at the same lexical nesting level.  (In other words, a clean-up
	   handler is established only during the execution of a specified section of code.)

	   Calling   longjmp(3)   (siglongjmp(3))   produces   undefined   results   if   any   call  has  been  made  to
	   pthread_cleanup_push() or pthread_cleanup_pop() without the matching call of the pair since  the  jump  buffer
	   was  filled  by setjmp(3) (sigsetjmp(3)).  Likewise, calling longjmp(3) (siglongjmp(3)) from inside a clean-up
	   handler produces undefined results unless the jump buffer was also filled by setjmp(3)  (sigsetjmp(3))  inside
	   the handler.
